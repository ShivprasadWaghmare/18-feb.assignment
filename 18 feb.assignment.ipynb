    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "     an API can be used to connect virtually any processes.\n",
    "     e.g.\n",
    "     A.Sharing flight information between airlines and travel sites. \n",

    "    ADVANTAGES   of APIs:\n",
    "Faster development: Leverage existing functionality, saving time and effort.\n",
    "Increased functionality: Add features to your app without building them yourself.\n",
    "Improved user experience: Create seamless integrations with other apps.\n",
    "Scalability: Build applications that can handle growing demand easily.\n",
    "New revenue streams: Monetize your data or functionality through paid APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Disadvantages of APIs:\n",
    "Security risks: APIs can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly secured.\n",
    "Dependency: Reliant on the stability and availability of the external API.\n",
    "Complexity: Learning and using APIs can add complexity to your project.\n",
    "Cost: Some APIs require paid subscriptions or usage fees.\n",

    "Definition: A web-based API designed for interaction over the internet using HTTP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access: Accessed through URLs and interacts with data formats like JSON and XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Facilitates communication between web servers and clients, enabling data exchange and functionality sharing.\n",

    "    REST:\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectural style for APIs, based on web principles like HTTP verbs and resource identifiers.\n",
    "Pros: Flexible, lightweight, stateless, scalable, supports various data formats (JSON, XML etc.).\n",

    "\n",
    "    SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol for accessing web services, uses XML messages and envelopes.\n",
    "Pros: Standardized, secure, reliable, good for complex transactions.\n",
    "Cons: Verbose, heavy messages, less scalable, limited flexibility, only XML data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    SOAP Shortcomings:\n",
    "Verbosity: Large XML messages increase bandwidth and processing time.\n",
    "Complexity: Strict standards make development and implementation complex.\n",

    " ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Architectural style, flexible, no strict rules.\n",
    "SOAP: Protocol, rigid, follows specific message format (XML).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data format:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Supports various formats like JSON, XML, plain text.\n",
    "SOAP: Uses XML only.\n",

    "Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Faster, smaller messages, easier caching.\n",
    "SOAP: Slower, larger messages, complex processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "State:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Stateless, each request independent.\n",
    "SOAP: Stateful, server maintains context of previous requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Requires additional security measures.\n",
    "SOAP: Built-in security features like WS-Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Easier to understand and implement.\n",
    "SOAP: More complex syntax and structure.\n",

    "Use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Web APIs, lightweight communication, modern apps.\n",
    "SOAP: Legacy systems, secure transactions, enterprise integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, REST is simpler, faster, and more flexible, while SOAP is stricter, more secure, and better for complex transactions. Choosing between \n",
